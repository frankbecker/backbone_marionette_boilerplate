backbone_marionette_boilerplate
===============================

This boilerplate was built using Node.js, Grunt and all the NPMs necessary to concatenate and minify both javascript and CSS.
I use LESS as my CSS compiler.
Marionette on top of Backbone.js to manage views, layouts, regions and garbage collection.
And Grunt does all the work.
